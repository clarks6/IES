Lab5 Q2 and Q3's code
Question2 deals with generating a PWM based on the parameters given via software.
Question3 deals with generating a PWM based on give parameters given via hardware.

Lab6 Q1 and Q2's code
Question1 gets temperature measurement from the internal temperature sensor.
Question2 gets temperature measurements from the internal and external temperature sensor. Q2 code has the external sensor marked as a humidity sensor, but it is in
face the external temperature sensor. This was done because the external sensor doubles as a humidity and temperature sensor.
